The following is just my take on the whole matter. Since we’re all waiting for the official reveal of the GME partnership, maybe this puts it a bit in perspective. To reach top 10 in terms of MC we would need to accumulate about 30 Billion Dollars. This would be 2x GMEs current MC.\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmRlLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABsSwG_1_ZY8_yLtI9gNt0PDQV1gzHcsRzTJu9wjvSmnBW1yXoHtx8bteXvxBhUi1Qn2bz_VeOkeFnhOy9oe69JARgnre8Xa-DMbWkUFCzm0JC3QcMIrUQ-0AVz_4brCCwnig3CnDhYxs-K7LrpwxqdMcugfvC7JaFpM0LtYYGWh\\n\\nReaching top 10 seems quite manageable, taken the current growth rate in the last week into account. A MC of 30 Billion would mean a price per coin of about 24$.\\n\\nThis should be our price target … for the moment. But expecting it to blow up to 100, 200 or even 600$ by the end of the year is just crazy. Don’t get me wrong on this, off course I’d love to see those gains, but don’t fool yourself and be sad when it „only“ reaches 10 or 20$. Also take into account the massive sell off that’s going to occur at those prices. How many of those who spam „HODL“ in the comments really have the diamond balls required to don’t take gains and panic sell when a massive drop comes?\\n\\nAgain, I myself expect a bright future for loopring, but this is no short term play. It might take years to reach a 100 Billion MC, not to speak of 500 Billion or more.\\n\\nSo calm down, put your phone away for a few days and wait at least for the GME announcement. But don’t be sad if the price stagnates for a bit or even drops hard. As we all know, buy the rumours, sell the news. I’ve experienced something quite similar in may with Doge and Elon Musk appearing on SNL. Everybody expected Doge to skyrocket afterwards and what happened - the exact opposite. So plan your exit wisely and take gains on the way up.\\n\\nJust my 2 cents, no financial advice and now go ahead and downvote into oblivion.\\n\\nTL;DR 24$ / coin in the next weeks might be a target, everything above is just pure luck and speculation.', 'More than are willing to raze their hands.', 'we need to keep the price above 3.25, its consolidating now expecting a decent move soon', 'GME LRC ETH holy trinity', 'Ape since January.

The following is just my take on the whole matter. Since we’re all waiting for the official reveal of the GME partnership, maybe this puts it a bit in perspective. To reach top 10 in terms of MC we would need to accumulate about 30 Billion Dollars. This would be 2x GMEs current MC.\\n\\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmRlLw&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABsSwG_1_ZY8_yLtI9gNt0PDQV1gzHcsRzTJu9wjvSmnBW1yXoHtx8bteXvxBhUi1Qn2bz_VeOkeFnhOy9oe69JARgnre8Xa-DMbWkUFCzm0JC3QcMIrUQ-0AVz_4brCCwnig3CnDhYxs-K7LrpwxqdMcugfvC7JaFpM0LtYYGWh\\n\\nReaching top 10 seems quite manageable, taken the current growth rate in the last week into account. A MC of 30 Billion would mean a price per coin of about 24$.\\n\\nThis should be our price target … for the moment. But expecting it to blow up to 100, 200 or even 600$ by the end of the year is just crazy. Don’t get me wrong on this, off course I’d love to see those gains, but don’t fool yourself and be sad when it „only“ reaches 10 or 20$. Also take into account the massive sell off that’s going to occur at those prices. How many of those who spam „HODL“ in the comments really have the diamond balls required to don’t take gains and panic sell when a massive drop comes?\\n\\nAgain, I myself expect a bright future for loopring, but this is no short term play. It might take years to reach a 100 Billion MC, not to speak of 500 Billion or more.\\n\\nSo calm down, put your phone away for a few days and wait at least for the GME announcement. But don’t be sad if the price stagnates for a bit or even drops hard. As we all know, buy the rumours, sell the news. I’ve experienced something quite similar in may with Doge and Elon Musk appearing on SNL. Everybody expected Doge to skyrocket afterwards and what happened - the exact opposite. So plan your exit wisely and take gains on the way up.\\n\\nJust my 2 cents, no financial advice and now go ahead and downvote into oblivion.\\n\\nTL;DR 24$ / coin in the next weeks might be a target, everything above is just pure luck and speculation. ,More than are willing to raze their hands. ,we need to keep the price above 3.25, its consolidating now expecting a decent move soon ,GME LRC ETH holy trinity ,Ape since January.
